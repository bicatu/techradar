Serverless First,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"The AWS Serverless stack provides the ability to deploy functionality without being burdened by the underlying infrastructure.  In our experience, it has also led to cost savings and more straightforward auto-scaling strategies.  This technology has been driving our mobile application's backend for over a year and successfully handling traffic spikes and many concurrent requests.  Most of the kinks and process difficulties associated with the service provisioning have been ironed out, which leads us to move this platform to the ""Adopt"" ring.  We, therefore,  encourage teams to consider the serverless platform as their preferred platform for new microservices going forward."
DocumentDB with mongoDb compatibility,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"As an AWS managed service that provides MongoDb compatibility, we promote its usage as the prefered option for document stores. It offers an easy scalling management and security management. This solution was adopted by many service such as Returns and PIM services, without much effort and was seamless."
Federated GraphQL,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Federation combines the GraphQL APIs from multiple (microservice) teams into a single API. With graphql-transform-federation you can add federation to (managed) GraphQL services, generated GraphQL schemas or other GraphQL APIs. Previously the only way to add federation, was to modify your GraphQL schema. Federated GraphQL at SSENSE will be adopted only by customer facing applications and core customer-facing applications will federate into ag-constellation."
Self managed on EC2,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"Whether for MongoDb or Kubernetes, we are moving away from hosting applications on self-managed EC2 instances.  We prefer to transfer the operational burden of keeping instances secured and patched to our cloud provider.  Therefore, we are migrating our Kubernetes cluster to EKS and our MongoDBs to AWS DocumentDB or ATLAS, the foremost being the preferred option."
AWS StepFunctions,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,Use to orchestrate execution of services that leverage Saga patterns or event to offset some concerns such a rerying to the infrastructure
Encryption-at-rest and Encryption-in-transit,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Enforce encryption-at-rest for all of data stores (databases, EBS volumes, S3 buckets, Elastic Search, respective backups)  and encryption-in-transit for all of it's network connections to be GDPR compliant"
Centralized documentation ,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,Centralized diagrams and domain documentation (LucidChart and Google docs)
AWS CDK + SAM,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,Use of AWS Cloud Development Kit as a way to leverage the project's programming languages to define infrastructure and reduce the dependency on serverless-framework
DynamoDB,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,Use of DynamoDB in conjunction with Serverless for storage of session data or other data where the access pattern is well established and fairly stable
API expand-contract,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,Aka parallel change to implement backward incompatible changes to an interface
Mutation Tests,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Pilot the use of tools which ensures tests are not just giving code coverage, but actually testing functionality and highlight missing test cases in the process"
UI/BFF Shared types,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"When the UI and BFF are done with same language (typescript) and maintained by the same team, you can use them in the same repo and share the contracts (types of Input and Output) between them"
Esbuild,Assess,Tools,TRUE,Esbuild promises order of magnitude increase in the build time with potential reduction on the generated artifacts. This can help improve the development experience by reducing the feedback cycle time.
Python for microservices,Hold,Languages & Frameworks,,"To facilitate leveraging gains of scale, only existing python projects or future ML/data based ones should be leveraging this language. Favour TypeScript for new micro-services and lambdas."
Typescript for microservices,Adopt,Languages & Frameworks,,"The use of typescript has been successful so far and to leverage the gains associated with scale this has been chosen as general purpose language to be used."
Monorepo per Domain,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Consolidate SSENSE domain driven development strategy, grouping new sub-domains inside its parents, following list of domains as defined here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eCn0CX9p1ye6A-wbFRJxJJzSQKifT7q4tKPi6Z_MWxs/edit#gid=0"
